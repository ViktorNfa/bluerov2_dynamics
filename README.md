## Files

1. **BlueROV2.py**  
   Contains the core `BlueROV2` class for 6-DOF ROV dynamics, plus an optional `Tether` class for lumped-mass tether modeling.  
   - To activate the tether:  
     ```python
     rov.use_tether = True
     rov.tether = Tether(...)
     rov.tether_state = <initial array>  
     rov.anchor_pos = [x0, y0, z0]
     ```
   - On each call to `rov.dynamics(...)`, tension forces are added in body-frame.

2. **test_euler.py**  
   Demonstrates **simple forward-Euler** integration of the ROV (and tether if enabled). This prints results at each step in real time.

3. **test_ode.py**  
   Demonstrates **implicit integration** using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp(method="BDF")`. This is more stable for stiff tether dynamics. Prints results at each sampled time.

Both the Euler and ODE methods should yield consistent results (though the implicit solver is typically more stable for large thrust or stiff tethers).
